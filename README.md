# Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT)
========

An implementation of the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) including media content display and subjective feedback collection.

## General information
From the respective [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit-association_test):
> The implicit-association test (IAT) is a measure within social psychology designed to detect the strength of a person's automatic association between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory. The IAT was introduced in the scientific literature in 1998 by Anthony Greenwald, Debbie McGhee, and Jordan Schwartz. The IAT is now widely used in social psychology research and, to some extent, in clinical, cognitive, and developmental psychology research. The Brief IAT (BIAT) is--as the name says--a shorter version of the IAT and consists of two blocks of trials with the same four categories and stimulus-response mappings as the standard IAT, but with 1/3 the number of trials. Unlike the standard IAT, the BIAT focuses the subject on just two of each block's four categories.
